# A Kickstart to Real Time Deep Learning Video Streaming

Throughout the article, we‚Äôll cover the basics of video data, what libraries you could use, understand video formats, and set up a basic app to stream media between two entities (API, Client).

<b>We're going to learn about the following: </b>

- video format components
- video re-encoding process
- tools to work with video in Python
- streaming video using HTTP
- streaming video using WebSockets
- streaming video using WebRTC

## Dependencies

- [Python (version 3.19)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Miniconda (version 24.1.2)](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html)
- [Poetry (version 1.7.1)](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [GNU Make (version 3.81)](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

## Install

We're using Poetry to manage the env and dependencies of this project.
<b> You don't need a GPU to run this </b>

To install, run this following command:

```shell
make install_env
```

This will create a new conda environment called `py39video`, activate it and install dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml`.

## Usage

The `Makefile` found at the root of this project, contains 5 commands:

- `install_env` : installs all the required packages
- `run_api` : will start the FastAPI backend
- `run_ui` : will start the React Web app

Here's the full command-set to start the solution:

1. Start Backend : `make run_api`
2. Start Frontend : `make run_ai`
